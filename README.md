The purpose of this project is to explore the role of global phosphorous cycling in the unusual geochemical landscapes of the late Neoproterozoic. We aim to account for a variety of factors including biogeochemistry, erosion, and sedimentary deposition within their tectonic context.

Our strategy is to construct a simple box model representing components and interrelationships of the global phosphorous reservoir. This model follows, e.g., chapter 5 of Chameides & Perdue's _Biogeochemical Cycles._ The basic construction is a linear system of the form:

$$\mathbf{y}'(t) = A(t)\mathbf{y}(t) + \mathbf{b}(t).$$
