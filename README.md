The purpose of this project is to explore the role of global phosphorous cycling in the unusual landscape of the late Neoproterozoic. We aim to account for a variety of factors including biogeochemistry, chemical erosion, and sedimentary deposition.

The basic construction is a linear system of the form:

$$\mathbf{y}' = A\mathbf{y} + \mathbf{b}.$$
